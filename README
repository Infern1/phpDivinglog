CODE DOCUMENTATION
    http://rob.lensen.nu/devdoc/phpdivinglog

EXAMPLE WEB SITE:
    NEW version:
    - http://rob.lensen.nu/divelog_new/
    OLD version:
    - http://www.borrett.id.au/divelog/


DEPENDENCIES:
	
    Included in the package:
    - JpGraph 1.22 (http://www.aditus.nu/jpgraph/)
    - RTFClass (http://www.phpclasses.org/browse/file/7632.html)
      Rich Text Format - Parsing Class - (c) 2000 Markus Fischer
    - Lightbox JS v2.0 (http://www.huddletogether.com/projects/lightbox2/)
      Used to overlay dive pictures on the current page.

USAGE:
	GOOGLE MAPS
	Version 1.2+ supports a user provided link to Google Maps.

	If you add a line like:
		[url]http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&t=k&om=1&ll=-38.356776,144.772693&spn=0.005645,0.007124[/url]
	in the Dive Location Details Comments, it will get 
	turned into a link to the specified Google Map.


	DIVE PICTURES
	Version 1.3+ supports dive pictures.

	For ease of use, all dive pictures should be imported 
	into diving log from the same directory,
	e.g. E:\divelog\images\pictures.

	(To make it easy to know which picture is which, I also
	use filenames like 27_1.jpg, 27_2.jpg, 23_1.jpg,
	being the first and second pictures for dive number 27, 
	and the first picture for dive number 23. But all that 
	is required is that each picture filename be unique.)

	Set the path to your pictures on your web site
	in the file locations section of includes/config.inc.php,
	for example...
$_config['picpath_web'] = "images/pictures/";

	Upload your new pictures to the directory on your web server.

	In version of Diving Log prior to version 4.0.5,
	after you do your MySQL Dump from Diving Log, you would
	need to edit the .sql file produced to strip out the path 
	from the picture filenames. For example,
	your full picture pathnames might be,
	"E:\divelog\images\pictures\27_1.jpg".
	Search for "E:\divelog\images\pictures\"
	and replace it with "", leaving just "27_1.jpg".

	However, with the changes to the Diving Log MySQL Dump
	option in version 4.0.5, you should no longer need to
	do this editing.

	Save the edited MySQL Dump file and upload it into 
	your web database.

	For the dive pictures to work with Lightbox JS v2
	the following has to be somewhere in your 
	includes/header.tpl file...
 <script type="text/javascript" 
  src="includes/lightbox/prototype.js"></script>
 <script type="text/javascript" 
  src="includes/lightbox/scriptaculous.js?load=effects"></script>
 <script type="text/javascript" 
  src="includes/lightbox/lightbox.js"></script>
 <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="screen"
  href="includes/lightbox/lightbox.css">


	EQUIPMENT PHOTOS
	Version 1.4+ supports equipment photos.
	Use the same guidelines as for the dive pictures. 


	MAP IMAGES
	Version 1.4+ supports map images.
	Use the same guidelines as for the dive pictures. 


	CERTIFICATION SCAN IMAGES
	Version 1.7+ supports map images.
	Use the same guidelines as for the dive pictures. 

	METRIC & IMPERIAL UNITS
	Version 1.7+ supports display units as either metric or imperial.

	Diving Log stores all depth, pressure, weight, temperature 
	and volume values in metric units. Thus metric units are 
	exported via MySQL Dump and imported into your online
	MySQL database.

	However, like Diving Log, phpDivingLog gives you the option
	to display values using either metric or imperial units.

	If you wish to have values display with imperial unit values, 
	you will need to edit the 'Unit Conversion' values in the 
	includes/config.inc.php file.

	Set the unit configuration values to 'true' if you want to convert
	values and have them display as imperial units, or to 'false' if 
	values should be displayed as metric units. 


	DIVE SUMMARY

	divesummary.php is a PHP script that can be called 
	from a standard HTML page to show some dive log 
	summary details in that web page, plus links to phpDivingLog.

	To invoke it on a Linux / Apache based server,
	add the following line to your .htaccess file:
		AddHandler server-parsed .htm

	Then, in the HTML file you want the output from
	divesummary.php to appear in, place the following line 
	where you want the output to go:
		<!--#include virtual="../divelog/divesummary.php" -->


	LANGUAGE COMPARE SCRIPT

	A language file comparison PHP script has been sourced and added.
	Those of you either maintaining or building new language file
	for phpDivingLog will find this script useful.

	The script is includes/languages/compare.php. It needs to be 
	where the language files are. Call it from the browser: 
	http://example.com/divelog/includes/language/compare.php?f=danish 
	to check "danish.inc.php" against "english.inc.php".


	DIVE PROFILE GRAPH

	Version 1.7+ supports the display of a dive profile graph
	without a background image. You can choose to provide a 
	suitable 500 x 400 background image file (gif or jpg) and 
	specify the path to it in the configuration file 
	'config.inc.php'.

	By default, phpDivingLog will use the setting for the length 
	units in the configuration file to determine if metres or 
	feet will be used in the dive profile graph. It will show 
	the primary units as the left side Y scale, and the 
	secondary units as the right side Y scale.

	Via seetings in the configuration file 'includes/config.inc.php',
	you can choose to show only the left Y scale, both the left
	and right Y scales with the same primary units, or with
	the primary units as the left side Y scale, and the 
	secondary units as the right side Y scale (the default
	setting).

	WARNING: If you choose to use a background image, it is
	likely that the colour settings specified in 'drawprofile.php'
	may not be ideal. Your solution is to edit these colour
	settings to produce a set that you like, which works well
	with your background image.
