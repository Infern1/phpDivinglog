INSTALLATION:

	Sorry, there is no installer. It is a manual process.


	THE BASICS

	Do you have FTP software? You will need a decent FTP software
	package to transfer files back and forth from your computer.

	Do you have a good Text Editor? You will nedd one to modify
	some of the phpDivingLog files during installation, plus the 
	MySQL Dump file you load into your web MySQL database.

	Do you have access to your web host Control Panel, or some 
	other way to create a MySQL database and user? If not, you
	may have to ask tour web host to do that for you.

	Do you have access to phpMyAdmin, or some other way to
	load data into a MySQL database?


	BEGIN INSTALLATION

1.	Create a MySQL database on your server, e.g. YOURNAME_divelog.
	Create or assign a MySQL database username and password to the database
	with ALL privileges.

2.	Edit the file config.inc.php and replace the values for...
// database information
$_config['database_server'] = "localhost";
$_config['database_db'] = "your_database";
$_config['database_username'] = "your_username";
$_config['database_password'] = "your_passwordj";
	with the appropriate values for your database.

3.	If you are planning to use a language file other than
	includes/languages/english.inc.php, then you will
	also need to specify the language in the configuration file
	includes/config.inc.php by changing the value for...
// language setting determines which language file is used
$_config['language'] = "english";

4.	If you wish to have values display with imperial units values
	instead of metric ones, you will need to edit the 'Unit Conversion'
	values in the includes/config.inc.php file.
	Set values to true if you want to convert from metric units 
	to imperial units, or to false if values should be left as metric units. 

5.  You can change the templates in tpl/ directory. Here you can
    change phpDivinglog into your own taste.

6.	You can change the styles used to display values by
	editing the CSS file includes/divelog.css.

7.	You may need to edit the file 
	includes/jpgraph/src/jpg-config.inc
	to set the cache and font directory values. 

	The files includes/jpgraph/src/jpg-config.inc and 
        includes/jpgraph/src/jpg-config-linux.inc already
	have the values used sucessfully on Linux based systems.
DEFINE("CACHE_DIR","/tmp/jpgraph_cache/");
DEFINE("TTF_DIR","includes/jpgraph/fonts/");
DEFINE("MBTTF_DIR","includes/jpgraph/fonts/");

	The file includes/jpgraph/src/jpg-config-windows.inc 
	has the values used on a Windows platform.

8.	Upload, via FTP, all of the files into a directory on 
	your server. Example: /divelog. If you know your location
    change config.inc.php according:
    /**
     * change this to your website url
     */
    $_config['web_root']        = 'http://www.mydivesite.com/divelog'; 
    /**
     * Your path where divelog is located
     * EXAMPLE: http://www.foo.com/users/j/jo/john
     * abs_url_path = /users/j/jo/john
     * Nothing todo where phpdivinglog is installed on your harddrive!
     */
    $_config['abs_url_path']    = '/divelog'; 

	Each web host has his/her own preference in naming 
	folders for use in running a website.
	You can have many files that don't even get shown to 
	the public. The ones that are available for access via 
	a browser are usually in a folder called something like: 

	- /home/YOURNAME/public_html
	or
	- /var/www/YOURNAME/httpdocs
	or
	- /usr/accounts/a/b/YOURNAME/httpd
	etc, etc, etc

	If it's unclear where the publicly-accessible files are 
	to be uploaded, talk to your webhost for assistance.

	Typically on a Linux based server you would make sure
	you set permissions on your directories to 755 and files
	to 644 or 444, depending on your web server configuration.
	The Linux commands to do this are:
	  find divelog/ -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;
	  find divelog/ -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;

9.	Do a MySQL Dump from Diving Log 4.0.5
	(http://www.divinglog.de/english/home/index.php)
	On the 'General' tab...
	  Logbook: Select all of your dives.
	  Format: Select 'Structure and Data' and select "With 'DROP TABLE'".
	  Tables: Select all tables.
	On the 'Additional' tab...
	  Typically you would just select 
	    'Remove all pathnames (export only filenames)'
	Click n 'Start Export'

10.	Edit the dump file produced as required to change
	the pathnames to images, if yu were unable to achieve 
	what you needed using the options on the 'Additonal' tab.
	(See USAGE below for details.)

11.	Use phpMyAdmin or similar to upload the data into your 
	MySQL database.
